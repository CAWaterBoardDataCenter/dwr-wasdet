## Demand Datasets

The demand datasets provided in the tool fall under two categories: 1) Reported Diversions, and 2) Estimated Demands. The original sources for each demand category are the monthly reported diversions as reported on each water right's annual diversion and use report, maintained in the Water Board's [electronic Water Rights Information Management System]() (eWRIMS). The Reported Diversions datasets include the reported diversion information as is, whereas the Estimated Demand datasets include "cleaned up" demand estimates.  

### Reported Diversions  

The Reported Diversion datasets contain the monthly amounts diverted as reported by diverters or their agents on their annual diversion and use reports submitted for each water right or claim of right. The following table summarizes the available Reported Diversion Demand Scenarios.

The Overall Reporting Compliance Rate values indicate the statewide percentage of water rights or claims of right for which annual diversion and use reports have been submitted for each reporting year. A higher Overall Reporting Compliance Rate generally indicates a more complete dataset.  

### Estimated Demands  

The Estimated Demands datasets will contain the typical monthly demand estimates for each right in a watershed based on historical reported diversions. Estimated Demand datasets will be developed on a watershed basis, and will be added to the tool as they are completed. Typically, developing an estimated demand dataset includes adjusting for any over-reporting, identifying and removing duplicate reporting, among other tasks. As estimated demand datasets are included in the tool, a summary table similar to the one above will be provided, listing the watersheds for which datasets are available, and a more detailed description of how each dataset was developed.
