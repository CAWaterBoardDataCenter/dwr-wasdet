## Water Supply and Demand Visualization Tool
#### Explore California's Surface Water Demands  

### BACKGROUND  

With over 30 million Californians currently experiencing dry conditions, agencies and communities need better tools to increase water resilience. The Division of water Rights is developing standard methods, hydrologic models, and easy-to-use online tools to help us and the public better understand water supply and use in various watersheds throughout the State.  

This Water Supply and Demand Visualization Tool is the first of several tools we will be releasing publicly over the next two to four months. Additional tools include a standardized methodology to clean up reported diversion data, water supply modeling tools, and water allocation tools. Each of these releases is planned to include a public webinar or workshop, and opportunity to solicit stakeholder feedback. More details on these tools, and their proposed release dates, will be provided shortly.  

### WHAT IS THE VISUALIZATION TOOL?  

Think of the tool as a historic checking account balance, allowing users to select previous years and see the amount of water input into the system as water supply, and the amount taken out of the system as water diverted. The tool is not designed to be a detailed or real-time water availability model, but rather a high-level look at historic supply and demand, as well as forecasted supply, where available.
