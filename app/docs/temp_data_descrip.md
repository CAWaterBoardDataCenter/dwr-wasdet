For each class of or unique supply/diversion scenario:  

1. Provide original source of data and when it was retrieved.  
2. Describe what dataset or dataset class represents, such as, "Reported Diversions for Calendar Year 2018," or, "Mean monthly full natural flow at CDEC Station YRS."  
3. Describe any adjustments made to the dataset.  
4. Describe any caveats for using the data set, such as, "dataset is 60% complete (reports were submitted for 60% of the water rights that year, indicating potential underestimate of reported diversions."
