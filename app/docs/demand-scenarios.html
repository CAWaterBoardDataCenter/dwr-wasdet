<h2 id="demand-datasets">Demand Datasets</h2>
<p>The demand datasets provided in the tool fall under two categories:
1) Reported Diversions, and 2) Estimated Demands. The original sources
for each demand category are the monthly reported diversions as reported
on each water right’s annual diversion and use report, maintained in the
Water Board’s <a href="">electronic Water Rights Information Management
System</a> (eWRIMS). The Reported Diversions datasets include the
reported diversion information as is, whereas the Estimated Demand
datasets include “cleaned up” demand estimates.</p>
<h3 id="reported-diversions">Reported Diversions</h3>
<p>The Reported Diversion datasets contain the monthly amounts diverted
as reported by diverters or their agents on their annual diversion and
use reports submitted for each water right or claim of right. The
following table summarizes the available Reported Diversion Demand
Scenarios.</p>

<p>The Overall Reporting Compliance Rate values indicate the statewide
percentage of water rights or claims of right for which annual diversion
and use reports have been submitted for each reporting year. A higher
Overall Reporting Compliance Rate generally indicates a more complete
dataset.</p>
<h3 id="estimated-demands">Estimated Demands</h3>
<p>The Estimated Demands datasets will contain the typical monthly
demand estimates for each right in a watershed based on historical
reported diversions. Estimated Demand datasets will be developed on a
watershed basis, and will be added to the tool as they are completed.
Typically, developing an estimated demand dataset includes adjusting for
any over-reporting, identifying and removing duplicate reporting, among
other tasks. As estimated demand datasets are included in the tool, a
summary table similar to the one above will be provided, listing the
watersheds for which datasets are available, and a more detailed
description of how each dataset was developed.</p>
