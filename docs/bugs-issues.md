# Collaborate With Us!

The underlying application code, data preparation code, and related documents are publicly hosted on the [Project GitHub page](https://github.com/jyeazell/dwr-wasdet).  

If you find a bug or error in the application please report it on the [Project GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/jyeazell/dwr-wasdet/issues).  

If there is a feature you think might be helpful to add to the application, start a discussion to describe the feature and explain the utility it would provide. You can do that on the [Project GitHub Discussions page](https://github.com/jyeazell/dwr-wasdet/discussions).  

Although GitHub is our preferred method to collaborate with the public and stakeholders on developing DWR-WaSDET, we understand some may not have or want a GitHub account. In that case, please send any comments, concerns, bugs, or suggestions to our [Division of Water Rights Measurement email box](mailto://dwr-measurement@waterboards.ca.gov). Please include "WaSDET:" in the subject line.

Thank You!
